# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

Hello connections, I am pleased to share that I completed my first project using PowerBi in which I have created an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard. I have picked the dataset from YouTube channel of “Rishabh Mishra”.

Objective:  To gain insights into the attrition patterns within the organization and helping the organization to gain a deeper understanding of employee turnover and its underlying causes by visualizing attrition data and trends.

Analysis:  By analyzing various metrics such as employee count, attrition, attrition rate, average age of employees leaving the organization, average salary, average years worked  at company, attrition by gender, attrition by age group, job satisfaction rating, attrition by job roles, education field wise attrition, the dashboard aims to achieve valuable insights by creating meaningful relationships between these attributes.

Process:
1. Importing the dataset into PowerBi, transforming the data, data cleaning( removing duplicates, null values) in the power query editor.
2. Using DAX , calculated Average age, Average salary etc. and created additional columns (conditional column) as per requirement.
3. I have included important KPIs such as Total employees, Attrition count, Attrition rate, Average age, average salary and Years at company.
4. Finally created different types of visualizations such as donut chart, stacked bar chart, stacked column chart, treemap, matrix, area chart to get meaningful insights.

Insights:
1. Total employee count is 1470 among which 237 workers are leaving the organization out of which 133 of them are from Research & development department.
2. Average age of employees is 37, whereas the highest number of employees leaving the company are between the age group of 25-35.
3. Education wise attrition indicated that highest number of people leaving the organization are from Life Science(38%) background, followed by Medical and Marketing.
4. In attrition by gender we see that more number of Males(140) left the organization than females(79).
